# The Hidden Costs of Traditional Surveillance

Businesses in the UAE spend millions on surveillance systems, yet most are unaware they're overpaying by up to 85%. Traditional cloud-based surveillance systems come with hidden costs that compound over time, creating an unsustainable financial burden for organizations across Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and the broader GCC region.

## Breaking Down the Numbers: Cloud vs Edge

### Traditional Cloud Surveillance Costs

A typical 50-camera deployment in Dubai using cloud-based solutions incurs:

- **Cloud Storage:** AED 15,000/month for 30-day retention
- **Bandwidth:** AED 8,000/month for continuous streaming
- **Processing Fees:** AED 5,000/month for AI analytics
- **Hardware:** AED 200,000 initial investment
- **Annual Total:** AED 536,000 + initial hardware

### Edge AI with Triya

The same 50-camera deployment with Triya's edge AI:

- **Cloud Storage:** AED 0 (on-premise storage)
- **Bandwidth:** AED 0 (local processing)
- **Processing Fees:** AED 0 (edge computing)
- **Hardware:** Existing cameras + AED 50,000 edge server
- **Annual Total:** AED 50,000 one-time + minimal maintenance

**Savings: 85% reduction in total cost of ownership**

## Real Case Studies from the UAE

### Dubai Retail Chain: AED 2.4 Million Saved

A major retail chain with 200 stores across Dubai and Abu Dhabi switched from cloud surveillance to Triya's edge AI platform:

- **Previous Annual Cost:** AED 2.8 million
- **Current Annual Cost:** AED 400,000
- **Annual Savings:** AED 2.4 million
- **ROI Period:** 3 months
- **Additional Benefits:** 90% faster incident detection, 100% data sovereignty

### Abu Dhabi Manufacturing Facility: 87% Cost Reduction

A large manufacturing facility in Abu Dhabi Industrial City transformed their surveillance:

- **Camera Count:** 150 cameras
- **Previous System:** Cloud-based with manual monitoring
- **Cost Before:** AED 1.2 million/year
- **Cost After:** AED 156,000/year
- **Savings:** 87% reduction
- **Bonus:** Automated PPE compliance monitoring included

## The Hidden Costs You're Not Seeing

1. Bandwidth Escalation Cloud surveillance consumes massive bandwidth. A single 4K camera streaming 24/7 uses approximately 2TB of data monthly. With UAE business internet costs, this adds up quickly.

2. Storage Inflation Cloud storage costs increase exponentially with retention requirements. Compliance often requires 90-180 day retention, multiplying storage costs by 3-6x.

3. Processing Latency Costs Cloud processing introduces 2-5 second delays. In security scenarios, these delays can mean the difference between preventing and merely recording incidents.

4. Downtime Losses Internet outages mean surveillance outages with cloud systems. Triya's edge AI continues working offline, ensuring zero downtime.
