**Example Finding:** "End-cap display generates 2,000 views but only 0.5% conversion. Side aisle display gets 400 views but 8% conversion."
**Action:** Relocate products for 4x sales increase

### Promotion Performance

Track in real-time:
- Traffic increase during promotions
- Actual vs. projected attendance
- Demographic shift analysis
- Cross-selling effectiveness

### A/B Testing in Physical Retail

**Week 1:** Display A configuration
- Traffic: 1,000 customers
- Engagement: 15%
- Conversion: 3%

**Week 2:** Display B configuration
- Traffic: 1,000 customers
- Engagement: 25%
- Conversion: 7%

**Decision:** Implement Display B across all stores

## Staff Optimization: Right Person, Right Place, Right Time

**Results:**
- Labor costs reduced by 20%
- Customer service scores increased 30%
- Sales per labor hour increased 45%

## Inventory Intelligence: Stock What Sells
