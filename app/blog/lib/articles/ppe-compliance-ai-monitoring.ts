# The Silent Crisis in Workplace Safety

Every 15 seconds, a worker dies from a work-related accident. Every day, 6,500 people die from occupational diseases. Most of these tragedies share one common factor: failure to use proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Yet monitoring PPE compliance remains one of the most challenging aspects of workplace safety.

## The PPE Compliance Challenge

### The Human Monitoring Problem

Traditional PPE monitoring relies on:
- Spot checks by safety officers
- Self-reporting by workers
- Supervisor observations
- Periodic audits

**The Reality:**
- Safety officers can only observe 5% of work time
- Workers remove PPE when unsupervised
- Supervisors focus on productivity over safety
- Audits catch past violations, not current risks

### The Staggering Cost of Non-Compliance

**Global Statistics:**
- 2.78 million workplace deaths annually
- 374 million non-fatal injuries yearly
- 4% of global GDP lost to occupational injuries

**For Your Business:**
- Average workplace injury cost: AED 150,000
- OSHA violation fine: Up to AED 500,000 per incident
- Insurance premium increase: 30-70% after claims
- Legal settlements: AED 1-10 million
- Reputation damage: Immeasurable

## Enter AI: Your 24/7 Safety Officer

### How AI PPE Monitoring Works
