## الخلاصة

تطورت المراقبة المدعومة بالذكاء الاصطناعي من أداة أمنية أساسية إلى منصة شاملة تحول سلامة وأمن وكفاءة تشغيل موقع البناء عبر منطقة الإمارات ودول مجلس التعاون الخليجي. يخلق الجمع بين منع الوصول غير المصرح به ومراقبة الامتثال لمعدات الحماية الشخصية وسلامة المعدات الثقيلة ومنع السرقة وتوثيق المشروع قيمة قابلة للقياس طوال دورات حياة المشروع.

بالنسبة لشركات البناء العاملة في بيئة دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي الصعبة، تعالج المراقبة بالذكاء الاصطناعي احتياجات حرجة متعددة في وقت واحد: حماية العمال في ظروف قاسية، وتأمين الأصول القيمة، وضمان الامتثال التنظيمي، وتوفير الشفافية والثقة لأصحاب المصلحة.

توفر الحلول القائمة على الحوسبة الطرفية مثل منصة Triya مزايا خاصة لتطبيقات البناء، حيث تعمل بشكل موثوق في البيئات القاسية، وتعمل بدون اتصال شبكة قوي، والحفاظ على سرية المشروع من خلال المعالجة المحلية، وتوفير الأداء في الوقت الفعلي الأساسي لتطبيقات السلامة.

مع استمرار نمو قطاع البناء في دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي بمشاريع ضخمة طموحة وتركيز متزايد على سلامة العمال والأمن، ستصبح المراقبة بالذكاء الاصطناعي بنية تحتية قياسية بدلاً من تعزيز اختياري، مما يساعد في بناء مستقبل المنطقة بأمان وأمان وكفاءة.`
