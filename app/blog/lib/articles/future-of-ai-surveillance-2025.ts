## 8. الاستدامة والمراقبة الموفرة للطاقة

أصبحت كفاءة الطاقة عاملاً تمييزياً حاسماً في تقنية المراقبة بالذكاء الاصطناعي. مع التزامات الاستدامة من الإمارات (صافي صفر بحلول 2050) والمملكة العربية السعودية (أهداف رؤية 2030 البيئية)، يجب أن تُظهر أنظمة المراقبة استهلاكاً أقل للطاقة إلى جانب أداء أعلى.

### ابتكارات كفاءة الطاقة

- **الرقائق العصبية الشكلية:** معالجات ذكاء اصطناعي جديدة مستوحاة من الدماغ البشري تستهلك طاقة أقل بـ 10-100 مرة من وحدات معالجة الرسومات التقليدية مع الحفاظ على قدرات المعالجة في الوقت الفعلي.
- **المعالجة التكيفية:** أنظمة ذكاء اصطناعي تضبط قدرة المعالجة بناءً على مستويات النشاط، تعمل بأقل طاقة خلال الفترات الهادئة وتتصاعد أثناء الأحداث المكتشفة.
- **أجهزة الحافة بالطاقة الشمسية:** عقد مراقبة مكتفية ذاتياً تعمل بالألواح الشمسية مع بطاريات احتياطية، مثالية لمراقبة البنية التحتية عن بُعد في البيئات الصحراوية.
- **نماذج ذكاء اصطناعي محسّنة:** تقنيات ضغط النماذج والتكميم تقلل المتطلبات الحسابية بنسبة 80% دون التضحية بدقة الكشف.

### الجدوى الاقتصادية

| نوع النظام | استهلاك الطاقة (50 كاميرا) | تكلفة الطاقة السنوية (الإمارات) | البصمة الكربونية |
|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| السحابي التقليدي | 15,000 كيلوواط ساعة/سنة | 7,500 درهم | 7.5 طن ثاني أكسيد الكربون |
| الطرفي القياسي | 5,000 كيلوواط ساعة/سنة | 2,500 درهم | 2.5 طن ثاني أكسيد الكربون |
| الطرفي المحسّن | 2,000 كيلوواط ساعة/سنة | 1,000 درهم | 1.0 طن ثاني أكسيد الكربون |

يمكن للمؤسسات التي تنشر مراقبة ذكاء اصطناعي موفرة للطاقة تقليل البصمة الكربونية لبنيتها الأمنية بنسبة تصل إلى 85% مقارنة بالأنظمة السحابية التقليدية.

## 9. شبكات الجيل الخامس وتأثيرها على شبكات المراقبة

يفتح نشر شبكات الجيل الخامس عبر دول الخليج إمكانيات جديدة للمراقبة بالذكاء الاصطناعي كانت غير عملية سابقاً. بينما يقلل الذكاء الاصطناعي الطرفي الاعتماد على السحابة، يُعزز الجيل الخامس طبقة الاتصال التي تربط أنظمة المراقبة الموزعة معاً.

### قدرات الجيل الخامس للمراقبة

- **تأخير فائق الانخفاض:** يوفر الجيل الخامس تأخيراً أقل من 10 مللي ثانية للاتصال بين الأجهزة، مما يُمكّن التنسيق في الوقت الفعلي بين مئات الكاميرات والمستشعرات.
- **كثافة أجهزة هائلة:** يدعم الجيل الخامس ما يصل إلى مليون جهاز لكل كيلومتر مربع، مما يجعل عمليات نشر المراقبة المتكاملة مع إنترنت الأشياء على نطاق واسع ممكنة للمدن الذكية.
- **تقطيع الشبكة:** شرائح شبكة افتراضية مخصصة تضمن حصول بيانات المراقبة على عرض نطاق مضمون وأولوية، حتى أثناء ذروة استخدام الشبكة.
- **حوسبة الحافة المتنقلة (MEC):** تتضمن بنية الجيل الخامس قدرات حوسبة طرفية عند أبراج الخلايا، مما يخلق طبقة معالجة موزعة بين الأجهزة ومراكز البيانات.

### ميزة الجيل الخامس في دول الخليج

تحتل الإمارات والمملكة العربية السعودية مراتب متقدمة بين الرواد العالميين في نشر شبكات الجيل الخامس. نشرت اتصالات ودو وSTC وموبايلي شبكات جيل خامس واسعة النطاق توفر العمود الفقري للاتصال لأنظمة المراقبة بالذكاء الاصطناعي من الجيل التالي. بحلول عام 2027، من المتوقع أن تنمو أنظمة المراقبة المتصلة بالجيل الخامس عبر دول الخليج بنسبة 300%، مدفوعة بمشاريع المدن الذكية ومتطلبات البنية التحتية الحيوية.

## 10. دور منصات الذكاء الاصطناعي العربية أولاً في الشرق الأوسط

من الاتجاهات المهمة والتي غالباً ما يُتجاهل في المراقبة بالذكاء الاصطناعي ظهور منصات ذكاء اصطناعي عربية أولاً مصممة خصيصاً لسوق الشرق الأوسط. عامل مزودو المراقبة العالميون تاريخياً دعم اللغة العربية كأمر ثانوي، مما أدى إلى انخفاض الدقة وتجربة مستخدم سيئة للمشغلين الناطقين بالعربية.

### لماذا العربية أولاً مهمة

- **كفاءة المشغّل:** يستجيب مشغلو الأمن الذين يتفاعلون مع الأنظمة بلغتهم الأم أسرع بنسبة 40% للحوادث ويرتكبون أخطاء أقل بنسبة 60% في إعداد التقارير.
- **دقة التحليلات الصوتية:** تكشف نماذج الصوت المدربة على العربية التهديدات في الكلام العربي بدقة تتجاوز 95%، مقارنة بـ 60-70% للنماذج الإنجليزية المُكيّفة.
- **الامتثال التنظيمي:** تتطلب العقود الحكومية بشكل متزايد واجهات ووثائق وقدرات إعداد تقارير باللغة العربية.
- **فهم السياق الثقافي:** تُنتج نماذج الذكاء الاصطناعي المدربة على المعايير السلوكية الإقليمية إنذارات كاذبة أقل في بيئات الشرق الأوسط.

### فرصة السوق

من المتوقع أن يصل سوق المراقبة بالذكاء الاصطناعي في الشرق الأوسط إلى 4.2 مليار دولار أمريكي بحلول عام 2028. المنصات التي تدعم العربية أصلياً وتفهم ممارسات الأعمال الإقليمية وتمتثل للوائح المحلية في موقع يؤهلها للاستحواذ على غالبية هذا النمو، بينما يكافح المزودون العالميون لتوطين عروضهم بفعالية.
